# SimpleNN

A simple neural network implementation using NumPy for educational purposes.
It demonstrates basic usage of object-oriented programming and also the forward and backward propagations for neural networks.
The following components are implemented so far:

Layer
* Linear
* ReLU
* Sigmoid
* Tanh
* Softmax
* LogSoftmax
* Dropout
* BatchNorm

Loss function
* Mean square error
* Binary cross-entropy
* Cross-entropy
* Negative Log-likelihood

Solver
* SGD (with momentum)
